# CroxyProxy Blocklist
This is a List of IP's used by CroxyProxy.com to include in your firewall policies. Made to block CroxyProxy. Some firewalls don't come with a list of IP's when it comes to block proxies. That's why I made the list accesible.

## Disclaimer
Most of IP addresses come from [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/505258-croxyproxy-ip-selector-plugin-for-gartic-io-kick-scripts/code) website. The rest was added later.
